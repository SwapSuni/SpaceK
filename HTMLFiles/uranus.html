            <h2>Surface And Atmosphere</h2>
            <ul class="atmosphere">
                <li>There is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior.</li>
                <li>The outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere.</li>
                <li> The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar. </li>
                <li> The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, the stratosphere and the thermosphere.</li>
                <li>The composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium.</li>
                <li>The abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere are poorly known.</li>
                <li>The outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona.</li>

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>At ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus's atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant planets.</li>
                <li>Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune.</li>
                <li>The tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of Uranus.</li>
                <li>There are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim.</li>
                <li>Uranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low thermal flux. </li>
                <li>The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49 K, making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Neighbours</h2>
            <ul class="neighbours">
                <li>Uranus has 27 known natural satellites.</li>
                <li>The five main satellites are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.</li>
                <li>The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of Triton (largest moon of Neptune).</li>
                <li>The largest of Uranus's satellites, Titania, has a radius of less than half that of the Moon.</li>
                <li>Among the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface, with the fewest impact craters, and Umbriel the oldest.</li>
                <li>The Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre.</li>
                <li>The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts.</li>
