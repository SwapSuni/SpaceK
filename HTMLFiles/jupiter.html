            <h2>Surface And Atmosphere</h2>
            <ul class="atmosphere">
                <li>Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume.</li>
                <li>It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements but, like the other giant planets in the Solar System, it lacks a well-defined solid surface.</li>
                <li>Jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds of ammonia crystals, which may contain ammonium hydrosulfide as well.</li>
                <li>The cloud layer is about 50 km deep.</li>
                <li>There may be a thin layer of water clouds underlying the ammonia clouds, as suggested by flashes of lightning detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter. </li>
                <li>The process of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable stellar ignition was achieved.</li>
                <li>Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through the lower atmosphere.</li>

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>Jupiter is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.</li>
                <li>Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere.</li>
                <li>This planet is believed to be the oldest planet in the Solar System.</li>
                <li>Jupiter's rotation is the fastest of all the Solar System's planets, completing a rotation on its axis in slightly less than ten hours.</li>
                <li>It's magnetic field is the strongest of any planet in the Solar System. </li>
                <li>Jupiter radiates more heat than it receives through solar radiation, due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism within its contracting interior, this process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 1 mm/yr. </li>
                <li>When it formed, Jupiter was hotter and was about twice its current diameter.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Neighbours</h2>
            <ul class="neighbours">
                <li>Jupiter has 80 known natural satellites, of these, 60 are less than 10 km in diameter.</li>
                <li>The four largest moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, collectively known as the "Galilean moons", and are visible from Earth with binoculars on a clear night.</li>
                <li>As the most massive of the eight planets, the gravitational influence of Jupiter has helped shape the Solar System. </li>
                <li>Jupiter has been called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner because of its immense gravity well and location near the inner Solar System. </li>
                <li>Jupiter has a faint planetary ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles known as the halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring.</li>
                <li> These rings appear to be made of dust.</li>
