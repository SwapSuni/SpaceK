            <h2>Surface And Atmosphere</h2>
            <ul class="atmosphere">
                <li>The total surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2 Of this, 70.8% is below sea level and covered by ocean water.</li>
                <li>The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of -418 m at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m at the top of Mount Everest. </li>
                <li>The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. </li>
                <li>Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere of today.</li>
                <li>Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space.</li>
                <li>Earth provides liquid waterâ€”an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="card2">
            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.</li>
                <li>Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. </li>
                <li>Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface.</li>
                <li>Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons.</li>
                <li>During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. </li>
                <li>Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of almost 8 billion today.</li>
                <li>A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not originate there.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="card3">
            <h2>Neighbours</h2>
            <ul class="neighbours">
                <li>Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon. </li>
                <li>It orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth.  </li>
                <li>The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through tidal locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.</li>
                <li>The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth.</li>
                <li>The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. </li>
                <li>Earth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites, objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans. </li>
                <li>There are approx 5000 operational, human-made satellites orbiting Earth.</li>
