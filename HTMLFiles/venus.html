            <h2>Surface And Atmosphere</h2>
            <ul class="atmosphere">
                <li>Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from Earth in light.</li>
                <li>Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K.</li>
                <li>The mass of its atmosphere is 92 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface is about 93 times that at Earth's.</li>
                <li>Because of its runaway greenhouse effect, Venus has been identified by scientists such as Carl Sagan as a warning and research object linked to climate change on Earth.</li>
                <li>Above the dense CO2 layer are thick clouds, consisting mainly of sulfuric acid.</li>
                <li>Although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground.</li>
                <li>The clouds reflect and scatter about 90% of the sunlight that falls on them back into space. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>The highest point on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is therefore the coolest point on Venus, with a temperature of about 655 K.</li>
                <li>Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72 AU, and completes an orbit every 224.7 days.</li>
                <li> Venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243 Earth daysâ€”the slowest rotation of any planet. Because its rotation is so slow, Venus is very close to spherical.</li>
                <li>To the naked eye, Venus appears as a white point of light brighter than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun).</li>
                <li>Winds on Venus move at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest winds are only 10-20% rotation speed.</li>
                <li>Venus's extreme temperature and atmospheric pressure make water-based life as currently known unlikely.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="card3">
            <h2>Neighbours</h2>
            <ul class="neighbours">
                <li>Venus has no natural satellites. </li>
                <li>It has several trojan asteroids: the quasi-satellite 2002 VE68 and two other temporary trojans, 2001 CK32 and 2012 XE133. </li>
                <li>Alex Alemi's and David Stevenson's 2006 study shows Venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago.</li>
                <li>About 10 million years later, according to the study, another impact reversed the planet's spin direction and caused the Venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with Venus.</li>
                <li> An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.</li>
                <li>Venus is the closest planet to Earth.</li>
                <li>Venus "overtakes" Earth every 584 days as it orbits the Sun, it changes from the "Evening Star",to the "Morning Star".</li>
