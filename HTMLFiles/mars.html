            <h2>Surface And Atmosphere</h2>
            <ul class="atmosphere">
                <li>Mars, known as the Red Planet, is a mostly dry and dusty place.</li>
                <li>The surface of the planet Mars appears reddish from a distance because of rusty dust suspended in the atmosphere.</li>
                <li>From close up, it looks more of a butterscotch, and other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on minerals.</li>
                <li>Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. </li>
                <li>Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth.</li>
                <li>Mars lost its magnetosphere 4 billion years ago, possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes. </li>
                <li>Auroras have been detected on Mars.</li>

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets have a similar rotation period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane.</li>
                <li>Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. </li>
                <li>Observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized.</li>
                <li>During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25-30% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO2 ice (dry ice).</li>
                <li>Due to the smaller mass and size of Mars, the probability of an object colliding with the planet is about half that of Earth.  </li>
                <li>Mars has the largest dust storms in the Solar System, reaching speeds of over 160 km/h, These can vary from a storm over a small area, to gigantic storms that cover the entire planet. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="card3">
            <h2>Neighbours</h2>
            <ul class="neighbours">
                <li>Mars has two relatively small (compared to Earth's) natural moons, Phobos and Deimos. </li>
                <li> In about 50 million years, Phobos could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.</li>
                <li>The origin of the two moons is not well understood. </li>
                <li>Mars may have moons smaller than 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330 ft) in diameter, and a dust ring is predicted to exist between Phobos and Deimos.</li>
                <li>Mars is located closer to the asteroid belt, so it has an increased chance of being struck by materials from that source, Mars is more likely to be struck by short-period comets, just like Jupiter.</li>
