            <h2>Surface And Atmosphere</h2>
            <ul class="atmosphere">
                <li>Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant, a subclass of giant planet, because they are smaller and have higher concentrations of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn.</li>
                <li>At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium.</li>
                <li>The absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue. </li>
                <li>Neptune's atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions: the lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude.</li>
                <li>Models suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude. </li>
                <li> The planet is too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation.</li>
                <li>Neptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600 m/s nearly reaching supersonic flow.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="card2">
            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>Neptune's dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. </li>
                <li>Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other, unknown mechanism.</li>
                <li>Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating.</li>
                <li>Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, and lies over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight.</li>
                <li>Because Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation.</li>
                <li>Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide.</li>
                <li>Neptune's bow shock, where the magnetosphere begins to slow the solar wind, occurs at a distance of 34.9 times the radius of the planet.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="card3">
            <h2>Neighbours</h2>
            <ul class="neighbours">
                <li>Neptune has 14 known moons.</li>
                <li>Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune.
                <li>Triton is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration, it will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit.</li>
                <li>Neptune's innermost four moons—Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea—orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. </li>
                <li>Neptune has a planetary ring system, though one much less substantial than that of Saturn.</li>
                <li>Neptune's 164-year orbital period means that the planet takes an average of 13 years to move through each constellation of the zodiac.</li>
                <!-- <li> The water abundance of the rings varies radially, with the outermost ring A being the most pure in ice water.</li> -->
