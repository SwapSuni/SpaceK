            <h2>Surface And Atmosphere</h2>
            <ul class="atmosphere">
                <li>The surface temperature of Mercury ranges from 100 to 700 K at the most extreme places.</li>
                <li>It never rises above 180 K at the poles due to the absence of an atmosphere and a steep temperature
                    gradient between the equator and the poles.</li>
                <li>The icy regions are estimated to contain about 1014 to 1015 kg of ice.</li>
                <li>Mercury is too small and hot for its gravity to retain any significant atmosphere over long periods
                    of time.</li>
                <li>Water vapor is present, released by a combination of processes such as: comets striking its surface,
                    sputtering creating water out of hydrogen from the solar wind and oxygen from rock, and sublimation
                    from reservoirs of water ice in the permanently shadowed polar craters.</li>
                <li>Mercury's magnetic field is strong enough to deflect the solar wind around the planet, creating a
                    magnetosphere.</li>
                <li>According to NASA, Mercury is not a suitable planet for Earth-like life. </li>

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of all the planets in the Solar System.</li>
                <li>Mercury attains inferior conjunction (nearest approach to Earth) every 116 Earth days on average.
                </li>
                <li>Mercury is technically brightest as seen from Earth when it is at a full phase.</li>
                <li>The planet's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less
                    than Earth's density.</li>
                <li>Data from MESSENGER have strongly supported the existence of water ice in permanently shadowed
                    craters at Mercury's poles.</li>
                <li>In a very, very slow process, Mercury is getting smaller every day. It is estimated that the planet
                    is about 9 miles smaller than it was four billion years ago.</li>
                <li>The Romans named it after their fasted god, Mercury.</li>
                <li>The gravity on the surface is 0.38 times the gravity on the surface of Earth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Neighbours</h2>
            <ul class="neighbours">
                <li>Due to its small size, low gravity and closeness to the Sun, Mercury isn't able to keep its own satellite in place. </li>
                <li>Mercury doesn't have any rings. </li>
                <li>It is the closest planet to Sun in our Solar System.</li>
                <li>Perihilion, the point on Mercury closest to the Sun is 0.3 Astronomical Units.</li>
                <li>After Mercury, Venus is the closest planet to Sun which is 1.04 Astronomical Units far from Mercury itself.</li>
