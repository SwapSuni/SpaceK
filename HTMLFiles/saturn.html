            <h2>Surface And Atmosphere</h2>
            <ul class="atmosphere">
                <li>Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron-nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds).</li>
                <li>The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume.</li>
                <li>Saturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. </li>
                <li>The winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's.</li>
                <li>The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.</li>
                <li>Saturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700 °C at its core, and radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. </li>
                <li>Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in Jupiter and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.</li>

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <ul class="characteristics">
                <li>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.</li>
                <li>An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's.</li>
                <li>Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h, higher than on Jupiter .</li>
                <li>Its prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust.</li>
                <li>Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less. </li>
                <li>Saturn's core is considerably denser than water due to the atmosphere. </li>
                <li>Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Neighbours</h2>
            <ul class="neighbours">
                <li>Saturn has 83 known moons, 53 of which have formal names.</li>
                <li>In addition, there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40-500 meters in Saturn's rings, which are not considered to be true moons.</li>
                <li>Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings.</li>
                <li>Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its own, along with a tenuous atmosphere. </li>
                <li>Titan is the only satellite in the Solar System with a major atmosphere, in which a complex organic chemistry occurs, it is the only satellite with hydrocarbon lakes.</li>
                <li>Saturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique.</li>
                <li> The water abundance of the rings varies radially, with the outermost ring A being the most pure in ice water.</li>
